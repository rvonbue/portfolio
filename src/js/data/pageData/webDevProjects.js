      description: "I created this standalone app for the Naval Postgraduate School. It is a data visualization tool that shows the connections of different networks. It was made so you can upload .gexf files and view them graphically instead of looking at a spreadsheet.  The NSV app lets you run algorigthms to see which one uncovers the network faster. It is able to visualize thousands of nodes ands connections while still animating fluidly on three different views.",

Once they had recored the data this app could parse the results and create a realistic physics simulation.  There are controls to toggle experiment such as playback speed, physics controls, and camera controls.",

On this project I worked mainly on the front-end development. This was one of the most interesting projects I have worked on.  Some of the project restrictions were resolution max of 1024 x 768 and it must be compatable with IE7.",
